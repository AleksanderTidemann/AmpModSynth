# Amplitude Modulation Web Synth

An upgrade of the p5 [amplitude modulation example sketch](https://p5js.org/examples/sound-amplitude-modulation.html). Control the modulator with mouse movements and the carrier frequency with a small slider. Ready to implement inn any web application as it supports the new [auto-play policies](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/) in Chrome (resumes/suspends Web Audio Context when/if the user want's to play).
